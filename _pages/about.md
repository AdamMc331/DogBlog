<p>Grayson was the 14th foster dog that I helped. When he showed up at our door in July 2021, my husband and I knew he would be special. A week later we formally adopted him, and the rest has been history. This blog is meant to highlight the joys and thrills of being dog parents, while also acknowledging the reality that is caring for a reactive dog, and how we've shaped our lifestyle to best support him.</p>
